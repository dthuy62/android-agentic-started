# Code standards

## Conventions

- **Screens:** `XScreen` (stateful) + `XContent` (stateless, previewable, testable without Hilt).
- **State:** immutable data class; sealed interface when states are exclusive; `ImmutableList` for lists. Never
  parallel booleans such as `isLoading` + `hasError`.
- **Errors:** `data/` converts exceptions to `AppError`; repositories return `Outcome<T>`; the ViewModel maps `AppError`
  to UI state; screens map it to a string resource ([ADR 3](decisions/0003-return-outcome-for-expected-failures.md)).
- **Coroutines:** inject `DispatcherProvider`, never reference `Dispatchers.IO` directly; never swallow
  `CancellationException`.
- **Use cases:** only for real logic or reuse (`SendMessageUseCase`). No pass-through wrappers.
- **DI:** Hilt; interfaces in `domain/`, implementations in `data/`, all `@Binds` in `di/RepositoryModule`.
- **Navigation:** Navigation 3; each feature exposes `XRoute : NavKey` and `XScreen`; `NavGraph.kt` owns the graph.
- **Strings and spacing:** text from `res/values/strings.xml`, spacing from `ui/theme/Spacing`, colors and type from
  `MaterialTheme`.
- **Dependencies:** versions only in `gradle/libs.versions.toml`.
- **File size:** split a ViewModel or screen that passes ~400 lines. Large ViewModels are the usual way a clean
  structure rots.

## How much structure per feature

The dependency direction is fixed. The number of layers is the developer's call
([ADR 5](decisions/0005-scale-structure-with-feature-complexity.md)). Start at the lowest level that fits and move up
when a concrete pain appears:

| Level | Shape                                                                                                    | Example       |
|-------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 0     | screen, ViewModel, repository interface; one model shared by `ui/` and `domain/`; no use case, no mapper | `ui/settings` |
| 1     | add a use case for real or shared logic; split entity/DTO from the domain model when shapes differ       | `ui/chat`     |
| 2     | value objects and invariants in `domain/` when business rules need guarding                              | none yet      |
| 3     | Gradle modules, only when build time, ownership or compiler-enforced boundaries justify it               | none yet      |

Logic or a repository used by several features goes in `domain/`, never inside one feature.

## Testing

- ViewModels and use cases: plain JVM tests with fakes of domain interfaces and `MainDispatcherRule`; no mocking
  library. Put a new fake next to the existing ones (`ui/chat/Fakes.kt`).
- Assert on `state.value` and collected effects, not on internal calls. One behaviour per test, named after the
  behaviour. Cover the failure path with a fake that returns `Outcome.Failure`.
- Add Compose tests against `XContent` only when a screen has non-trivial rendering.

## Automated checks

- **Konsist** (`app/src/test/.../architecture/ArchitectureTest.kt`) fails the unit tests when `ui/` imports `data/`,
  `domain/` imports Android, Room or DataStore, or one `ui/<feature>` imports another. Features are discovered from the
  package layout, so new screens are covered without editing the test.
- **detekt** (`config/detekt/detekt.yml`, defaults plus a few relaxations) flags code smells. **ktlint** checks
  formatting with `.editorconfig` (`./gradlew ktlintFormat` fixes it).
- **`DocsTest`** (`app/src/test/.../docs/DocsTest.kt`, part of the unit tests) fails when docs link to or name files
  that no longer exist, when the package map misses a top-level package, or when a doc repeats a verify command that
  differs from `AGENTS.md`.
- **Where they run:** agent hooks while an agent edits, an optional pre-commit hook (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit`,
  enable with `scripts/install-git-hooks.sh`) running ktlint and detekt, and CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) running
  the full verify command from `AGENTS.md`. CI is the authoritative gate; the others give earlier feedback and can be
  skipped.
- A check that blocks a legitimate case is a conversation, not a wall: change the rule in a reviewed commit and record
  why in an ADR.

## Definition of done

The verify command in `AGENTS.md` passes, new ViewModel or use case logic has a unit test with fakes, and anything that
changed structure, commands or conventions is reflected in `docs/` or a new ADR.
